My views are shaped by a commitment to evidence-based policy-making and a recognition that complex problems often require nuanced solutions rather than ideological rigidity. I value both economic opportunity and social justice, believing that a well-functioning society needs to address both dimensions. While I may lean slightly left on social issues and slightly right on fiscal matters, I try to evaluate each policy proposal on its merits rather than through a partisan lens."
